For commit history please see the original repo: https://github.com/Adeamer/Project-2 
The code in this repo is broken as we faced alot of issues pushing the code to the main branch. We would get alot of conflicts but weren't able to resolve them in Git-Hib.
So we add the your-plant-house repo to get the app working.
